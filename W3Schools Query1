SQL Query 

source: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_join_left

--This shows a left join between the Customers and Orders table based on the CustomerID, selecting the CustomerName and OrderID column 
--and ordering the result by the first column 

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

/*This query specifies the column names from both tables that are to be used in the left join by using the format
Table1.ColumnName, Table2.ColumnName. This specification helps clarify what table each column corresponds to
As a left join, it means that all records FROM the customers table are included and those that match to the Orders table
are included as well. The join condition is where the CustomerID matches in both tables. Finally, the results are ORDERed BY the 
CustomerName column that corresponds to the Customers table.

SQL Query from w3Schools https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_upper.asp
--This query uses the UPPER function to convert some text to have all upper case letters

SELECT UPPER(CustomerName) AS UppercaseCustomerName
FROM Customers;

This query uses the UPPER function on the column CustomerName from the Customers table and uses a column 
alias to name that column as UppercaseCustomerName. Now all the customers' names are in all caps

-------Sample Output:
UppercaseCustomerName

ANA TRUJILLO EMPAREDADOS Y HELADOS
ANTONIO MORENO TAQUERÍA

BLONDEL PÈRE ET FILS
BÓLIDO COMIDAS PREPARADAS

Augmented:
SELECT UPPER(FirstName) AS UppercaseEmployeeFirstName, UPPER(LastName) AS UppercaseEmployeeLastName
FROM Employees;

I augmented this code by applying this function in the same way to another table: the Employees table. So I applied the 
upper function to the FirstName and the LastName colums of the Employees table and selected those columns, naming then 
UppercaseEmployeeFirstName and 	UppercaseEmployeeLastName respectively with 2 column aliases

----Augmented Sample Output:
UppercaseEmployeeFirstName	UppercaseEmployeeLastName
NANCY                     	DAVOLIO
ANDREW                    	FULLER

--This demonstrates the use of the LEN function to find the length of a specificied string

SELECT LEN('2017-08');
Ouput:
7

This code uses the LEN function on the string '2017-08' to calculate the legnth of it, which coms out to 7 as in the output

Augmented:
SELECT CustomerName, LEN(CustomerName) AS length
FROM Customers;

I used this LEN function on the Customers table to find the LENGTH of the CustomerName column from that table, which
was named length with a column alias. I also selected 
the CustomerName column to see the name of the customer along with it's calculated length side by side 

Augmented Sample Output:
CustomerName	length
Alfreds Futterkiste	19
Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	34

--This query shows the use of the LIKE operator to find Customers whose names start with the letter a

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

This query selects everything from the Customers table for those rows where the CustomerName column has values that start 
with a. The LIKE operator shows this as it will choose those names that start with a

-----Sample Output:

3  Antonio Moreno Taquería  Antonio Moreno Mataderos 2312  México D.F.  05023  Mexico 
4  Around the Horn  Thomas Hardy  120 Hanover Sq.  London  WA1 1DP  UK 

Augmented Code:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'c%';

I changed this query by changing the pattern to look for. Instead of getting information for customer names that start
with a, now it is for those that start with c.

SQL Query from w3Schools  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp
--This query labels the quantities corresponding to the OrderID as either greater than 30, 30, or less than 30 using the
CASE statement

SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30"
ELSE "The quantity is under 30"
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

This query selects the OrderID and Quantity columns from the OrderDetails table. It also uses the CASE statement to label the
quantities as either greater than 30, 30, or under 30. For example, it first checks if the Quantity is greater than 30. If it is,
then the column named with an alias QuantityText gets the value ""The quantity is greater than 30" for that row with the Quantity 
over 30. SImilarily, if the Quantity is 30, then it gets the value "The Quantity is 30", and lastly, if none of those conditions are
the case, then the ELSE part comes in, having the column QuantityText get the value "The quantity is under 30" for that row with
the quantity not greater than or equal to 30. It then has the END keyword and proceedes to use a column alias QuantityText, which
was the column that received all these values based on the quantity.

Sample Output:
OrderID     Quantity        QuantityText
10248        12 The quantity is under 30
10248        10 The quantity is under 30
10248         5 The quantity is under 30
10249         9 The quantity is under 30
10249        40 The quantity is greater than 30
10250       10 The quantity is under 30
10250       35 The quantity is greater than 30
10250       15 The quantity is under 30

Augmented Code:
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price,
CASE WHEN Price > 100 THEN "Expensive"
WHEN Price> 25 AND Price<100 THEN "The price is somewhat expensive"
ELSE "Good Price"
END AS PriceText
FROM Products;

 To augment the code I basically followed the same structure of the code to apply to the Products table and the column Price
 (instead of Quantity). So here I check the Price of each product, and based on that , the column named with an alias Pricetext
 will be given the value "Expensive" , "The price is somewhat expensive", or "Good Price" for each product from the Products table
 For example, if the Price is greater than 25 but less then 100, then the column PriceText gets the value "The price is somewhat 
 expensive"
 
------Augmented Sample Output:
ProductID ProductName Price PriceText
1 Chais 18.00 Good Price
2 Chang 19.00 Good Price
3 Aniseed Syrup 10.00 Good Price
4 Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning 22.00 Good Price
5 Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix 21.35 Good Price
6 Grandma's Boysenberry Spread 25.00 Good Price
7 Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears 30.00 The price is somewhat expensive
8 Northwoods Cranberry Sauce 40.00 The price is somewhat expensive

SQL Query from W3Schools https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp
--This query selects those rows with all the columns from the Products table if the price is between 10 and 20, using the BETWEEN oper.

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

This query selects everything from the Products table and has the where clause to filter the results to only include those results 
where the Price falls in the range of 10-20. This is seen by the BETWEEN operatory which gives the range for the Price, and so if 
the price is between 10 and 20, then those rows are included

Sample Output:
ProductID ProductName SupplierID CategoryID Unit Price
1  Chais  1  1  10 boxes x 20 bags  18 
2  Chang  1  1  24 - 12 oz bottles  19 
3  Aniseed Syrup  1  2  12 - 550 ml bottles  10 
15  Genen Shouyu  6  2  24 - 250 ml bottles  15.5

25 NuNuCa Nuß-Nougat-Creme 11 3 20 - 450 g glasses  14 

Augmented:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
AND ProductName LIKE 'c%';

I augmented the program to include another search condition to include those rows from the products table which don't just have a price 
of 10 to 20, but also have the ProductName column have a value that starts with c. 
If both of these conditions are true, then those rows are incldued in the result set.

-------Augmeted Sample Output:
ProductID ProductName SupplierID CategoryID Unit Price
1  Chais  1  1  10 boxes x 20 bags  18 
2  Chang  1  1  24 - 12 oz bottles  19 
39  Chartreuse verte  18  1  750 cc per bottle  18 
48  Chocolade  22  3  10 pkgs.  12.75
